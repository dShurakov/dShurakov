💻 I spent the last year learning Java until I realized that I would like to make a living from this, as this is really what I like.

👨‍🎓 Now I'm studying Java Spring and Spring Boot at *****.***** courses. Projects from there can be found in my profile.

❤️ I try to write a lot of code and read more books 📚 and watch conferences of other developers.
